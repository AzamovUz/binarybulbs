# Binary & Decimals

A web application to visualize how binary and decimal numbers work. It shows "0"s (and "1"s) at the top as well as a decimal number right below. You can click "0"s (and/or "1"s) and swap them with one another. As you can guess, eight digits that you can play turning on/off make up a binary value. <br>

When you change binary number deciding the places for "0"s and "1"s, the decimal number that comes underneath them updates accordingly. You can click arrows up and down the decimal number to increment or decrement it while observing how binary number is changing, too. So, binary and decimal numbers work in concert in this app. <br>

The web application has also a game mode which helps you enter a decimal and try to change the binary (by turning digits 0 or 1) number in a way that matches the value of the input. When you guess the correct disposition of zeroes and ones, the application displays the announcement that says "You win!" <br>

There is an "ON"/"OFF" button that helps you switch on a hint: a set of decimal numbers that represent the value of zeroes and ones according to their place. For example, the first (from left to right) digit represents 128 while the last digit represents 1. <br>
